**Focus Currency** is a gamified productivity app that helps you regain control of your screen time. It locks distracting apps and requires you to "pay" to unlock them using virtual currency earned by solving educational problems.

## 🚀 How It Works
1.  **Select & Lock:** Choose apps that distract you (e.g., Social Media, Games).
2.  **Earn Capital:** Solve quick **Math**, **Logical Reasoning**, or **English** questions.
3.  **Spend to Access:** Use your earned **Capital (CAP)** to unlock apps for 5-minute sessions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
* **State Management:** `setState` (Lightweight)
* **Core Plugins:**
    * `usage_stats`: To monitor foreground apps.
    * `device_apps`: To list installed applications.
    * `shared_preferences`: To persist your Capital balance.
    * `glassmorphism`: For the modern UI aesthetic.
